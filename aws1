Some Points Need to understand While using aws instances
-ELASTICIP/DETACH IP FOR THE INSTANCES - WE ALLOCATE THE STATIC IP TO THE INSTANCES SO THAT WHEN INSTANCE GOT STOPPED THEN AGAIN RESTART IT CHANGE THE IP ADDRESS SO THAT WEBSITE MAY SLOWDOWN FOR SOME TIME
WE CAN ATTACH EBS VOLUMES WHILE INSTANCES IS RUNNING BUT MAKE SURE THAT VOLUMES' 
AVALIABILITTY ZONE SHOULD BE SAME AS INSTANCES IF NOT THEN IT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ADD IN THE INSTANCES
